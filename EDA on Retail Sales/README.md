# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales

## Introduction

In this notebook, we delve into an online retail dataset to extract valuable insights and patterns. The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, comprises transactional records of an online retail store. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to uncover trends, understand customer behavior, and identify potential opportunities for business growth.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Exploration:** We begin by loading and inspecting the dataset, exploring its structure and dimensions.
- **Missing Values:** Identification and handling of missing values in the dataset to ensure data integrity.
- **Cancellation Analysis:** Analysis of cancelled transactions and their impact on overall sales.
- **Product Analysis:** Examination of product purchase patterns, including the distribution of quantities and revenue per product.
- **Customer Analysis:** Exploration of customer demographics, including country-wise distribution and customer purchasing behavior.
- **Market Insights:** Insights into market trends, including the largest markets by sales revenue and customer base.
- **Product Recommendations:** Identification of top-selling products and recommendations for potential product bundling or marketing strategies.
